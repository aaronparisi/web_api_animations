BALL ANIMATION BUTTON
  - determine whether ball goes left, right, doesn't move, or straight down
  - num rotations
  - ball speed?
  - from = current location
  - to = ????
  - what happens after it 'finishes'?
    - is there a way to get it to 'go to the other side' and continue rolling?
    - I wonder if I just need 3 keyframes........
