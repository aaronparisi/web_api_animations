Q. does an update to an animation's playback rate result in a 'resetting' / 'alteration' of the iterations option?

=> seems the issue only appears when the playback goes from positive to negative.......
  - should I just make new animations at that point then?
  
"The updatePlaybackRate() method of the Web Animations API's Animation Interface sets the speed of an animation after first synchronizing its playback position."
  - I wonder what "synchronizing its playback position" entails......
